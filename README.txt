Algebraica is a library that allows to perform operations with complex numbers using Python 3.
The main purpose of creation of this library is solving nonlinear ODEs with Taylor series, though the library can be used for various other purposes.
Algebraica allows to create and store complex numbers as class Complex objects and perform mathematical operations on them. The operations include operations like addition, division, raising to power, and differentiation.
The library automatically simplifies expressions so that they would be easier to operate. It also allows to find numerical values of expressions, so that the user would get actual numbers on the output.
