Algebraica is a library, that allows to perform algebraic operations with complex numbers on Python3.
With the library, you can create, store and modify complex numbers. The library also features auto-simplification function, that makes the answers look less scary. It`s still in its` infancy, though, and so it probably has a lot of bugs in it, so be careful when working with it.
The library will try to compute as much numerical values as possible. For instance, ln(e) will become 1. If the library cannot compute a function, for exaple ln(pi), it tries to simplify the function in some other way.
In the examples, you can learn how to use the Algebraica library. They illustrate the tools available so far.
Be careful when working with this library as it probably has a LOT of bugs in it.
